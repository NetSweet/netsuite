# NetSuite Ruby SuiteTalk Gem

* This gem will act as a wrapper around the NetSuite SuiteTalk WebServices API. Wow, that is a mouthful.
* The gem does not cover the entire API, only the subset that we have found useful to cover so far.
* Extending the wrapper is pretty simple. Check out the [contribution help doc](https://github.com/RevolutionPrep/netsuite/wiki/Contributing-to-the-Supported-NetSuite-API)
* NetSuite development is overall a pretty poor experience. We have a list of [NetSuite Development Resources](https://github.com/RevolutionPrep/netsuite/wiki/NetSuite-Development-Resources) that might make things a bit less painful.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'netsuite'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install netsuite

This gem is built for ruby 1.9.x, checkout the [1-8-stable](https://github.com/RevolutionPrep/netsuite/tree/1-8-stable) branch for ruby 1.8.x support.

## Testing

## Usage

### Configuration
```ruby
NetSuite.configure do
  reset!
  
  # optional, defaults to 2011_2
  api_version	'2012_1'
  
  # optionally specify full wsdl URL (to switch to sandbox, for example)
  wsdl          "https://webservices.sandbox.netsuite.com/wsdl/v#{api_version}_0/netsuite.wsdl"
  
  # or specify the sandbox flag if you don't want to deal with specifying a full URL
  sandbox	true
  
  # often the netsuite servers will hang which would cause a timeout exception to be raised
  # if you don't mind waiting (e.g. processing NS via DJ), increasing the timeout should fix the issue
  read_timeout  100000
  
  # you can specify a file or file descriptor to send the log output to (defaults to STDOUT)
  log           File.join(Rails.root, 'log/netsuite.log')
  
  # login information
  email    	'email@domain.com'
  password 	'password'
  account   	'12345'
  role      	1111
end
```

### Examples

```ruby
# retrieve a customer
customer = NetSuite::Records::Customer.get(:internal_id => 4)
customer.is_person

# or
NetSuite::Records::Customer.get(4).is_person

# randomly assign a task
customer_support_reps = [12345, 12346]

task = NetSuite::Records::Task.new(
	:title => 'Take Care of a Customer',
	:assigned => NetSuite::Records::RecordRef.new(customer_support_reps.sample),
	:due_date => DateTime.now + 1,
	:message => "Take care of this"
)

task.add

# this will only work on OS X, open a browser to the record that was just created
`open https://system.sandbox.netsuite.com/app/crm/calendar/task.nl?id=#{invoice.internal_id}`

task.update :message => 'New Message'

# basic search
search = NetSuite::Records::Customer.search({
  basic: [
    {
      field: 'companyName',
      operator: 'contains',
      value: company_name
    }
  ]
})

`open https://system.netsuite.com/app/common/entity/custjob.nl?id=#{search.results.first.internal_id}`
```
