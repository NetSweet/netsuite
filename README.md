# Netsuite

* This gem will act as a wrapper around the NetSuite SuiteTalk WebServices API. Wow, that is a mouthful.
* The gem does not cover the entire API, only the subset that we have found useful to cover so far.
* [Extending the wrapper](#extending) is pretty simple. See below for an example.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'netsuite'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install netsuite

## Usage

### Customer

* Initializing a customer can be done using a hash of attributes.

#### Get

* Retrieves the customer by internalId.

    ```Ruby
    customer = NetSuite::Records::Customer.get(:internal_id => 4) # => #<NetSuite::Records::Customer:0x1042f59b8>
    customer.is_person                            # => true
    ```

## Additions

* Please submit a pull request for any models or actions that you would like to be included. The API is quite large and so we will necessarily not cover all of it.
* Records should go into the `lib/netsuite/records/` directory.
* Actions should be placed in their respective subdirectory under `lib/netsuite/actions`.
* Example:

    ```Ruby
    # lib/netsuite/actions/customer/add.rb

    module NetSuite
      module Actions
        module Customer
          class Add

            def initialize(attributes = {})
              @attributes = attributes
            end

            def self.call(attributes)
              new(attributes).call
            end

            def call
              response = NetSuite::Configuration.connection.request :add do
                soap.header =  NetSuite::Configuration.auth_header
                soap.body = {
                  :entityId    => @attributes[:entity_id],
                  :companyName => @attributes[:company_name],
                  :unsubscribe => @attributes[:unsubscribe]
                }
              end
              success = response.to_hash[:add_response][:write_response][:status][:@is_success] == 'true'
              body    = response.to_hash[:add_response][:write_response][:base_ref]
              NetSuite::Response.new(:success => success, :body => body)
            end

          end
        end
      end
    end

    response = NetSuite::Actions::Customer::Add.call(
      :entity_id    => 'Shutter Fly',
      :company_name => 'Shutter Fly, Inc.',
      :unsubscribe  => false
    )                 # => #<NetSuite::Response:0x1041f64b5>
    response.success? # => true
    response.body     # => { :internal_id => '979', :type => 'customer' }
    ```

## Gotchas

  * The Initialize Action duck-punches the .initialize method on any class that includes it.
    This has not proven to be a issue yet, but should be taken into account when analyzing any
    strange issues with the gem.
  * Some records define a 'class' field. Defining a 'class' field on a record overrides the
    #class and #class= methods for this class. This is very obviously a problem.  You can,
    instead, define a 'klass' field that will be turned into 'class' before being submitted
    to the API. The Invoice record has an example of this.
